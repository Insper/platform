Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with a relational database using an object-oriented programming language. It provides a way to map database tables to classes and database records to objects, allowing developers to work with data in a more intuitive and natural way. In the context of the Account microservice, we will use an ORM framework to handle the data persistence for the Account entity, which will allow us to easily create, read, update, and delete accounts in the database.



Flyway is a database migration tool that allows us to manage and version our database schema changes. It provides a way to define and execute database migrations, which are scripts that modify the database schema, such as creating tables, adding columns, or changing data types. In the context of the Account microservice, we will use Flyway to manage our database migrations, ensuring that our database schema is always up-to-date and consistent across different environments.
